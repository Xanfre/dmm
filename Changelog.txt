In the latter case, the archives will be moved to the new "DMMArchives" folder in the main Shock2 folder. They can be deleted if the user does not need them anymore.
Currently supported archive types: 7z, rar, zip, ss2mod (repackaged 7z, rar or zip file).

	SevenZip++ by Chadwick McNab (placed in public domain)
