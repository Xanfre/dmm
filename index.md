## About

The Dark mod manager (DMM) lets you install and organize mods for System Shock 2, Thief and Thief II in a straightforward manner.

## Requirements

| Game           | Version        |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| System Shock 2 | v2.4 or later  |
| Thief          | v1.19 or later |
| Thief II       | v1.19 or later |

## Installation

DMM is part of [SS2Tool](https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=4141.0) and is installed alongside it.
For a manual installation, download [the latest release](https://github.com/pshjt/dmm/releases/latest/download/dmm.exe) and preferably copy it to your game's main folder.
For mod archive support, a `7z.dll` needs to be present in the same folder as DMM.

## How to use

#### Install mods
Launch DMM. If the game is not yet detected, press **Select game folder...** and select your game's main folder.

Activate mods and arrange their priorities as needed. Mods that are higher on the list override every mod below it.

When finished, press **Apply changes** and **Launch game** to play.

If you want further information about a mod, you can press **Lookup (WWW)** to open a Google search or **Open a ReadMe** file if present. If you have no further use of a mod, you can **Delete** it, which removes the mod from both DMM, and your hard drive. 

#### Mod profiles
To save your current mod order for later re-use, open the profile manager via **Manage profiles...**.

Press **Save profile...** to save your current profile or **Load file...** to load a previous profile.

The result window shows a preview of your loaded profile. Mods which were deleted in the meantime cannot be loaded and are marked as such.

Press **Use** to apply the loaded profile, or simply close the window to discard your choice.
